# ziwft-to-garmin

This program is intended to pull activities from Zwift, change the recording device from 'zwift' to a Garmin device and then upload the changed fit file to Garmin Connect.  
It is **still a work in progress and not yet finished**.

# Requirements

This program depends on [zwift_client](https://github.com/jsmits/zwift-client) by jsmits, which I've [forked](https://github.com/wullxz/zwift-client/tree/update_deps) and have its dependencies updated and protobufs regenerated.
